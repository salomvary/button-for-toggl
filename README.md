# ⚠️ This is an unofficial fork of the [Toggl Track Extension](https://github.com/toggl/track-extension) formerly known as Toggl Button

Unfortunately, Toggl Track extension [got unceremoniously closed-sourced](https://github.com/toggl/track-extension/commit/f78590c447f30eaa3685d582a2ac888302bd8f41). The move was explained in [this blog post](https://toggl.com/blog/purposeful-open-source):

>  The main browser extension code will be closed, which will allow us to work on the extensions’ features more easily as it will allow us to share code with other projects.

Fortunately the original extension has BSD-3-Clause license which allows this fork to exist.

## Compatible services

Everything the official Toggl extension supports is supported by Button for Toggl as we use
the [same - still open source - code for integrations](https://github.com/toggl/track-extension).

## Installing from the Web Store/Addons page

#### On Chrome:

1.  Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and enable "Developer Mode".
2.  Choose "Load unpacked extension..."
